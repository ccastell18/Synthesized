      <p>This program creates a synthesizer using HTML and javascript</p>
      <p>Each time you hit PLAY, it creates an oscillator.  This will create a sound wave which is the basic building block of sound. There are four different waves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sine- has a smoother sound.</li>
        <li>Triangle- like a sine wave with, but slightly harsher.</li>
        <li>sawtooth- harsher than the triangle wave.</li>
        <li>square- used in many 80's video game soundtracks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By pressing play, the system creates a basic oscillator sound.  You can speed the frequency with the lever. The higher the frequency, the higher the sound. Pressing the button more than once and creaTap one of the waveform buttons to create different sounds.  The sound can also be altered by filters.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>High Pass Filter(HPF)- allows high frequencies to pass and filters out the lower frequencies.</li>
        <li>Low Pass Filter(LPF)- allows low frequencies to pass and filters out higher frequencies</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The LFO (low frequency oscillator) create a sine wave that affects the volume, making a wave sound. The lower the lever, the less volume affect on the sound. The initial sound is loud.</p>
      <p>It also displays the current weather in Austin. Just for fun!</p>
      <p>Click the button in the top right, with the picture of a theremin, take you to a page that lets your mouse recreate a theremin instrument.  The volume gets louder from top to bottom, and the frequency gets higher from left to right. Click the picture of Robert Moog, a pioneer of the synthesizer, and takes you back to the previous page. HAVE FUN!</p>
